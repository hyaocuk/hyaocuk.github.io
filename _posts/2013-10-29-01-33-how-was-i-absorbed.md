What makes me absorbed so much is JavaScript and GitHub. First when I focus on the GitHub I found that
most of the repositories are mainly written in JavaScript, I think it is owe to the reason that rich
web apps were flourishing and more and more needs of such apps emerged, the old technology such as static
HTML, non-MVC, over-Flash pages that ture your notebook a heater..., what we really need is something of 
lightweight and is fitting in the thing you need precisely. So we came the era of JavaScript and Ruby and
much of these frameworks and libraries developed by these dynamics languages.
